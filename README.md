# .NET Streamer
Old home-made popcorn time like application developped in C# (not working anymore).

The code is very old and awful.

It used to work using websites that hosted all kind of movies and tv shows like Icefilms or Primewire.

A complete review with screenshots was made by Softpedia back in the time. [Link here](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Video-Players/NET-Streamer.shtml)

And here is an old youtube video that previewed the application. [Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-siBv7isEI)
